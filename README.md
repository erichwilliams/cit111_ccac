My student work for the Spring Semester of 2018.

## Bio
I am a student at the Community College of Allegheny County, studying for my degree in Information Technology Support.
I am currently in my second semester, taking both online and in-person classes.
I always hope to become a more skilled and knowledgable person than I was yesterday.
